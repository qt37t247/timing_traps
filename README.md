# Timing traps

The purpose of timing traps:

1. Minimizing sampling effort
2. Controlled comprison of different sampling strategies
3. Applying massive monitoring with minimum observation variance
   

A trap comprises three modules:

1. Timer module
2. Bait module
3. Net module

Currently, there are two types of trap, which are differentiated by their bait module
